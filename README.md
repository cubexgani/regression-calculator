# Regression Calculator

A cool calculator which takes x and y values as input and fits them in a curve. It uses the method of least squares to find the curve equation. Currently supports only linear and quadratic regression as they are the only two I know.  
Also this is my first project in golang. I still don't know why I picked up a language which is completely foreign to me for this project.  
Hopefully this helps me do well in my math exams.

## Getting started
- Requires golang because I didn't build and release any executable.
- Also requires a terminal which can render the graph properly. If you're using Windows/WSL, use Windows Terminal to run this project. Optionally you can use a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) if the graph isn't being rendered properly in your current font, but it works just fine otherwise.
- `git clone` this repository.
- Go to the directory where the repository is cloned.
- Install the required dependencies using `go mod tidy`.
- Run it with `go run .` (best performance in full screen).

## Goals
- Handle resizing for result and choice screens
- Go outside for a walk
- learn about go testing
- Take up some non-cs hobbies
- Pass the math exam
- Add more regressions later on
