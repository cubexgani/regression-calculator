# Regression Calculator

A cool calculator which takes x and y values as input and fits them in a curve. Currently supports only linear and quadratic regression as they are the only two I know.  
Also this is my first project in golang. I still don't know why I picked up a language which is completely foreign to me for this project.  
Hopefully this helps me pass my math exams.

## Getting started
- Requires golang (obviously).
- `git clone` this repository.
- Go to the directory where the repository is cloned and `go run .`. Didn't try out `go build .` yet so just run the project like this.

## Goals
- Get this augmented matrix thing working
- Solve some system of equations
- Go outside for a walk
- Input x and y values
- Get the curve equation
- Bubbletea because I just want a cool looking TUI
- Take up some non-cs hobbies
- curve on display???
